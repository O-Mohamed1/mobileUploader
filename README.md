Upload files and images directly to PC via a locally hosted webpage

I got tired of uploading first to google drive or OneDrive and then downloading to my PC, and the iTunes PC app is annoying, so I'm making my way to transmit files via local router.
It can upload files directly and has an image function to prompt an IOS user for photos if they wish to upload those.
This requires node.js and npm 
In project directory, use command "npm install express multer" to install required packages
