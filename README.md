UNFINISHED, WORK IN PROGRESS

Upload files and images directly from iPhone to PC via a locally hosted webpage

I got tired of uploading first to google drive or OneDrive and then downloading to my PC, and the iTunes PC app is annoying, so I'm making my own way to transmit files via local router.
It can upload files directly and has an image function to prompt an IOS user for photos if they wish to upload those.
Making this in JS first then once I have a grasp of C++ I will remake it with that, to make the project a real executable app with a GUI instead of a webpage.
